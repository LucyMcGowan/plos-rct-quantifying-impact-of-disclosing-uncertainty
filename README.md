Hannah Mendoza and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the analysis in "Randomized Controlled Trial: Quantifying the Impact of Disclosing Uncertainty on Adherence to Hypothetical Health Recommendations". 
* The data is contained in the `data` folder under `dat.rds`.
* `analysis.R` contains R code to run all models and create all Tables included in the manuscript

The following is a data dictionary for the dataset:
